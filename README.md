Prototype for a floor panel on an autonomous ferry. The Adaptive Guidance System is designed to respond to passenger traffic. It uses two pressure sensors to dynamically adjust the guidance based on passenger weight. The system controls an LED matrix to indicate the recommended path based on the detected load. This system can help manage and direct passenger flow efficiently in busy environments.
